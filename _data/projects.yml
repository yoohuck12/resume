  description: OS can be installed in various environments such as Desktop, Notebook, Server, Virtual environment (VMWare, Virtual box, Hyper-V), Embedded computers, and Dummy computers without hard drive. The specification of each device is different from others, so it's not easy to install OS correctly in all of these environments. One of things should be considered is firmware. Firmwares have a wide variety of vendors, types, and ages. For example, firmware with initial version of UEFI have bad code for checking ROM variables for finding booting devices. There are also many naming issues in many different hardware interface. For example, a storage can be linked to a computer by using SCSI, SAS, SATA, and these interfaces are named differently in devfs of linux. All these things should be considered to install and bootstap your computers!
